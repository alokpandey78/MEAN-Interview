Sass supports placeholder selector using class or id selector by making use of @extend directive.


## 1. Nested Rules Example

   ```
 <body>
      <div class = "container">
         <h1>My First Heading</h1>
         <p>It is a CSS pre-processor which helps to reduce repetition with CSS and save the time. </p>
         <p>It is more stable and powerful CSS extension language.</p>
         <div class = "box">
            <h1>My Second Heading</h1>
            <p>It is initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006.</p>
         </div>
      </div>
   </body>

.container{
   h1{
      font-size: 25px;
      color:#E45456;
   }
   
   p{
      font-size: 25px;
      color:#3C7949;
   }
}

      </div>
   </body>

   a {

   &:hover { background-color: yellow; }

.line {
   font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;
   font-size: 20px;
   font-weight: bold;
   font-variant: small-caps;

      <h1>Second Heading</h1>
