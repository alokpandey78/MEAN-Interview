## Enums 

>>Enums allow us to define a set of named constants.

### Numeric enums
    enum Direction {
        Up = 1,
        Down,
        Left,
        Right,
    }
Up is initialized with 1. All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on. In other words, Direction.Up has the value 1, Down has 2, Left has 3, and Right has 4.
  
    enum Direction {
        Up,
        Down,
        Left,
        Right,
    }
Up would have the value 0, Down would have 1, etc. This auto-incrementing behavior is useful for cases where we might not care about the member values themselves, 

### String enums
While string enums don’t have auto-incrementing behavior

    enum Direction {
        Up = "UP",
        Down = "DOWN",
        Left = "LEFT",
        Right = "RIGHT",
    }

### Heterogeneous enums
Technically enums can be mixed with string and numeric members, but it’s not clear why you would ever want to do so:

    enum BooleanLikeHeterogeneousEnum {
        No = 0,
        Yes = "YES",
    }
