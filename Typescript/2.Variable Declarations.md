### let and const are two relatively new types of variable declarations in JavaScript.

## var declarations
    Scoping rules
    Block-scoping
    Re-declarations and Shadowing
    var declarations, we mentioned that it didnâ€™t matter how many times you declared

    function f(x) {
        var x;
        var x;

        if (true) {
            var x;
        }
    }

    const declarations

## Destructuring
    let input = [1, 2];
    let [first, second] = input;
    console.log(first); // outputs 1
    console.log(second); // outputs 2

## Object destructuring
    let o = {
        a: "foo",
        b: 12,
        c: "bar"
    };
    let { a, b } = o;

    let { a, ...passthrough } = o;
    let total = passthrough.b + passthrough.c.length;

## Spread

The spread operator is the opposite of destructuring. It allows you to spread an array into another array, 
or an object into another object

    let first = [1, 2];
    let second = [3, 4];
    let bothPlus = [0, ...first, ...second, 5];
    O/P gives bothPlus the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
