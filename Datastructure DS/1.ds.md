### Categories of Algorithm

> Sort: Algorithm developed for sorting the items in certain order.

> Search: Algorithm developed for searching the items inside a data structure.

> Delete: Algorithm developed for deleting the existing element from the data structure.

> Insert: Algorithm developed for inserting an item inside a data structure.

> Update: Algorithm developed for updating the existing element inside a data structure.

### Performance of algorithm
> Time complexity: It is a way of representing the amount of time needed by a program to run to the completion.

> Space complexity: It is the amount of memory space required by an algorithm, during a course of its execution. 
Space complexity is required in situations when limited memory is available and for the multi user system.
